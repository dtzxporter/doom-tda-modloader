# doom-tda-modloader
An unfinished mod loader for Doom The Dark Ages

### Info
While this is unfinished, it shows how to load files directly from disk, unpacked and without any need for checksum modification.

Streams can also be easily replaced by hooking it's read method on the entry vtable, of course, make sure the patched asset also reflects the new stream info.

This will not be updated.
